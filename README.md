# Personal Portfolio

## Description

A responsive, multi-page portfolio made using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap's CSS/JS library, and JQUERY. Consisting of a home/about me page, a portfolio, and a contact page, the site is fully responsive, adapting to changes in screen size and device. Thanks to bootstrap, this is done with a minimum of custom CSS, while also adhering to a standardized grid layout.

## Features:

- Adaptable, persistent navbar that expands for larger pages, then shrinks to a collapsable format once a certain breakpoint is reached, allowing for easy navigation on any device.
- Standardized grid layout makes content easier to read
- Semantic HTML used where applicable for clarity
- Custom CSS used sparingly, making for a clean, easily navigable styling sheet.
- Site abides by accessibility standards
- Dynamically placed HTML content using JS lightens HTML footprint
